Hello!

The test as been made in two separated files, logs_ui.py and logs.py

Let me know if that's what was expected from me, I am not sure if we needed only the total render time and total MEM usage or charts like I did.


I also included two exemple of tools I made in the past.


Card to Track - From selected Camera, rgb source and card It create 2D transformations nodes by placing axis to the corner of the selected card and uses reconcile nodes.

Export Dependencies - PYQT widget that gets all dependencies from the current nuke script or from selected nodes and copies them to a specified location in respective subfolders.


Have a great day!
